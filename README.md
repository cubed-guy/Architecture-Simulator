# Architecture-Simulator
This in the initial stages will be a python based custom language compiler.
(Python for compiling? Umm, that's like the only language I know.)

The architecture is based on an instruction set with only ONE instruction, namely assign.

All calculations will be performed by a special circuit called OP (short for operator).
This circuit is a grid of registers.
The rows depict inputs, while columns depict outputs.
Each register in the grid will define if there is a connection between the respective I/O.

More info will be added later.
